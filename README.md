# Project Title
Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Online payment systems face significant losses due to fraudulent transactions.
The goal of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model
that can identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Synthetic Data (generated for learning purposes)
- Size: 21497 rows, 23 features
- Target variable: `is_fraud` (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legit)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SQL (for data extraction)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ⚙️ Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)  
5. Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC  

## 📈 Key Results
- Precision:   
- Recall:   
- ROC-AUC: 

The model effectively balances fraud detection accuracy and business risk.
